The module provides various sinks and widgets to allow interaction with the live GNU Radio applications remotely over the network. The module uses Bokeh's client API and streaming features. Using widgets and plots from Bokeh, the module enables the GUI for GNU Radio that renders in web browser. Just like gr-qtgui, it is fully integrated with GRC to allow easy use.
